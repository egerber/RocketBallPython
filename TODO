THINKABOUT
- how to access forward Model 2

TODO:
- generate good trainigdata for forward model 2
- train rocketBall with non zero initial state
- Generalize the terms (such as speed) in inverse model so it can work with obstacle information and alike
- change move() procedures to take arrays
- Generate SequenceData including a variety of labyrinths with a fixed number of obstacles
- self-feeding mechanism that feeds constant labyrinth information into network

DEBUG:
- Check why generated movement from sequencegenerator2 always moves to the right and down only

TAGESZIEL:
- richtige Daten für ForwardModel2 generieren
- ForwardModel2 auf verschiedene Trainingssätze trainieren
- [Visualize anticipation for LabyrinthGrid Inverse Model]

TAGESZIEL:
- extend sequenceGenerator for labyrinth to create random labyrinth configuration and movements in it
    -> train network on it
    -> use seed to always generate the same obstacle configurations
    -> obstacle generator (takes: count_obstacles, seed)
- concept for self feeding mechanism including static input of obstalce array
- set speed to one hot vector after the iterations are done

DONE:
- Change code to work with batchsize
