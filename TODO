- how to access forward Model 2

TODO:
- generate good trainigdata for forward model 2
- train rocketBall with non zero initial state
- Implement Grid Labyrinth (movement x,yâ‚¬ {-1,1})
    -> Train forward Modell
    ->
- Train forward Model 2 (using inverse 4-2 model, self-feeding), where at each timestep the real information of the rocketBall is given)
